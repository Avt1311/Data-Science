        "# Theory Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        " - **Compiled languages** (e.g., C, C++) are converted into machine code before execution, making them faster.\n",
        " -**Interpreted languages** (e.g., Python, JavaScript) execute line-by-line, making debugging easier but slower.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        " - It helps handle runtime errors using *try, except, finally*, and *else* blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        " - The purpose of *finally* block is that it ensures that cleanup code (e.g., closing files) is always executed, regardless of exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        " - It records program execution details using the logging module.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  What is the significance of the __ del__ method in Python?\n",
        " - It is a destructor method that cleans up resources when an object is deleted.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        " - *import module_name* imports the whole module, while from *module_name import* function imports specific functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        " - Using multiple except blocks or a single except (Exception1, Exception2) as e: block.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        " - It ensures files are closed automatically after operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        " - Multithreading shares memory, while multiprocessing runs separate processes with independent memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        " - It helps with debugging, monitoring, and error tracking.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        " - Memory management in python  is handled automatically using garbage collection and reference counting.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        " - Use try to enclose risky code, except to catch exceptions, finally for cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        " - It prevents memory leaks and optimizes performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        " - *try* contains code that might fail, and *except* handles the errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        " - It uses reference counting and cyclic garbage collection to free memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        " - The purpose of else block is that it runs code only if no exceptions occur in try.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        " - Common logging levels in Python are\n",
        "     - DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        " - *os.fork()* creates child processes in UNIX, while multiprocessing works across OS.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        " - Importance of closing a file in Python:\n",
        "     - Prevents resource leaks and data corruption.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "  - * read()* reads the whole file, while *readline()* reads one line.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        " - Used to log messages for debugging and monitoring.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        " - Provides OS interaction, like file handling and directory operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        " - Garbage collection overhead and circular references.\n",
        "\n",
        "24.  How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        " - Using *raise Exception(\"Custom error message\").*\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        " - It improves responsiveness and efficiency in I/O-bound tasks.\n"
